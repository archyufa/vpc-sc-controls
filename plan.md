2.  **Design:** Design the VPC Service Controls architecture, including perimeters, access levels, and policies.
3.  **Implementation:** Implement the designed architecture in a dry-run mode.
4.  **Testing and Validation:** Test the implementation to ensure it meets the requirements.
5.  **Enforcement:** Enforce the VPC Service Controls policies.
6.  **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Monitor the VPC Service Controls and update the policies as needed.
